# WP-MF-Portfolio

WordPress theme used on my [personal portfolio](http://mimiflynn.com), [Kelly M Callahan's portfolio](http://kellymcallahan.com), and [Corinne Iozzio's portfolio](http://corinneiozzio.com).

## Features

- single page layout
- color customizer
- custom menus
- custom background image
- [TGM Plugin Activation](https://github.com/mimiflynn/TGM-Plugin-Activation) for theme dependency management / alerts
- custom post type for portfolio projects

## Disclaimer

This site takes a bit of configuring since it was hand tailored to my site (and a couple other portfolio sites). Its not really super ready to be released, but yet, here we are.

## To Do

- make main menu and scroll work more magically
